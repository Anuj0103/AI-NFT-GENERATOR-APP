# AI-NFT-GENERATOR-APP

1) Full Stack Web Application where the users can tell the AI the types of entities they want to create and it will give them the results accordingly.

2) Can create generative artwork inside the website itself based on the name and description provided.

3) App allows us to mint the nft with the image generated and we will pay the fee to do that through metamask and once we do it will be on the blockchain forever.

4) Uses IPFS to generate hash for each image that represents location of that file on the blockchain and then we linked them to the smart contract and then we send them to each individual wallet.

5) Uses ethereum blochain, solidity, huggingface that has an api called stable diffusion, nft.storage for ipfs
